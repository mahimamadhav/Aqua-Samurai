# Aqua-Samurai
Using ArcGis or sql spatial we want to map all the available water bodies in urban areas. Water flow diagrams (inlets and outlets ) are made available  online to check flow statistics.

Electronic GPS enabled devices are designed to dredge, remove waste and send water quality parameters time to time.

Solution for this project includes monitoring and controlling remotely all operations of water  purity.

All statistics and graphs are coordinated among all departments and private orgaizations who are commited to provide good water table for future generations.
Project will be uploaded  soon.
